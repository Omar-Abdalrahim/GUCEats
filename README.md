Hi !!!!
This is a food ordering app localized in the guc campus, you can view the menu of any restaurant present in the guc campus and add the items you want in the cart the view it whenever you like.
After done ordering you can go to the checkout page to complete your order and a confirmation from the restaurant will be sent to you . =)
# This app is implemented using kotlin, real time database (Firebase) and Cloud Storage provided by firebase.
===>NOTE: the VOIP is an external feature not actually required (only required for the course project) and it works only on android 10 or less
